extends RefCounted

# Pure fork path-picking logic, extracted from GameLoop / ForkScreen so it can be
# tested in isolation. Every function here is deterministic: external state
# (score, coins, item ownership, the random draw) is passed in by the caller, not
# read from autoloads or RNG. The callers stay thin glue.
#
#   Random      → weighted_pick(weights, r)         (caller supplies r = randi() % total)
#   Conditional → conditional_path(...)             (caller supplies score/coins value + is_owned)
#   Sacrifice   → path_affordable(...)              (caller supplies coins + is_owned)
#   Player Choice → no logic here; the index is whatever the player clicks.


# Picks the index whose cumulative-weight bracket contains r. `weights` are the
# per-path weights (negatives clamped to 0); r must be in [0, sum(weights)). The
# caller computes r from the RNG, keeping this deterministic. Empty → 0.
